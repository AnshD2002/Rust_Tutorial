# Rust Tutorial

Welcome to the Rust Tutorial! This guide will help you set up your first Rust project and get your code running.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
- If you haven't installed them yet, run: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Project
Use `cargo`, Rust's package manager, to generate the project structure.

```bash
cargo new Project_name
```
### 2. Run a Project
```bash
cargo run
```
### If you just want to check for compilation errors without running the binary (which is faster), you can use:
```bash
cargo check
```
